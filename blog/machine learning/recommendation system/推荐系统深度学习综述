Abstract
With the ever-growing volume of online information, recommender systems have been an effective strategy to overcome such information overload. The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given its widespread adoption in many web applications, along with its potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also the attractive property of learning feature representations from scratch. The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research. Evidently, the field of deep learning in recommender system is flourishing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning based recommendation models, along with providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art. Finally, we expand on current trends and provide new perspectives pertaining to this new exciting development of the field.

文中将其分为以下几类。
• Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a feed-forward neural network with multiple (one or more) hidden layers between the input layer and output layer. Here, the perceptron can employ arbitrary activation function and does not necessarily represent strictly binary classifier. MLPs can be intrepreted as stacked layers of nonlinear transformations, learning hierarchical feature representations. MLPs are also known to be universal approximators.
• Autoencoder(AE) is an unsupervised model attempting to reconstruct its input data in the output layer.In general, the bottleneck layer (the middle-most layer) is used as a salient feature representation of the input data. There are many variants of autoencoders such as denoising autoencoder, marginalized denoising autoencoder, sparse autoencoder, contractive autoencoder and variational autoencoder (VAE) .
• Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special kind of feedforward neural network with convolution layers and pooling operations. It can capture the global and local features and significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy. It performs well in processing data with grid-like topology.
• Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is suitable for modelling sequential data. Unlike feedforward neural network, there are loops and memories in RNN to remember former computations. Variants such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network are often deployed in practice to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.
• Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a two layer neural network consisting of a visible layer and a hidden layer. It can be easily stacked to a deep net. Restricted here means that there are no intra-layer communications in visible layer or hidden layer.
• Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) is an unsupervised neural network built atop autoregressive model and feedforward neural networks. It is a tractable and efficient estimator for modelling data distribution and densities.
• Adversarial Networks (AN) [46] is a generative neural network which consists of a discriminator and a generator. The two neural networks are trained simultaneously by competing with each other in a minimax game framework.
• Attentional Models (AM) are differentiable neural architectures that operate based on soft content addressing over an input sequence (or image). Attention mechanism is typically ubiquitous and was incepted in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing domains. However, it has also been an emerging trend in deep recommender system research.
• Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL). Reinforcement learning operates on a trial-and-error paradigm.
The whole framework mainly consists of the following components: agents, environments, states, actions and rewards. The combination between deep neural networks and reinforcement learning formulate DRL which have achieved human-level performance across multiple domains such as games and self- driving cars. Deep neural networks enable the agent to get knowledge from raw data and derive efficient representations without handcrafted features and domain heuristics.
